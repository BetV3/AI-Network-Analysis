### **Revised Project Title**: **AI-Powered Email Phishing Detection & Real-Time Threat Intelligence Platform**  
**Domain**: Networking (Email Protocols) + AI (NLP, Classification) + Data Analytics  
**Objective**: Build an intelligent system to detect phishing emails in real-time using NLP and anomaly detection, analyze attack patterns, and generate actionable threat intelligence.  

---

### **Key Components**  
1. **Email Data Ingestion**: Capture emails via IMAP/POP3, SMTP listeners, or API integrations (e.g., M365, Gmail).  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Parse email headers, body content, URLs, attachments, and metadata (e.g., sender reputation).  
3. **AI/ML Models**:  
   - **Phishing Classification**: NLP models (BERT, Transformer-based) to detect malicious intent.  
   - **URL Analysis**: Check links against threat databases (VirusTotal) + heuristics (obfuscated domains).  
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual sender behavior (e.g., sudden volume spikes).  
4. **Threat Intelligence Dashboard**: Visualize phishing trends, attacker tactics (MITRE ATT&CK), and user risk scores.  
5. **Automated Response**: Quarantine emails, alert users, and enrich data with threat feeds (AbuseIPDB).

### **Timeline (14 Weeks)**  

#### **Phase 1: Research & Design (Weeks 1–2)**  
- **Week 1**:  
  - Study email protocols (SMTP, IMAP), phishing techniques (e.g., spear phishing, spoofing).  
  - Identify datasets (Enron Corpus, CIC Phishing Dataset, real-world email logs).  
- **Week 2**:  
  - Design system architecture (email ingestion pipeline, model serving).  
  - Plan feature engineering (TF-IDF, regex for URL patterns, header analysis).  

#### **Phase 2: Environment Setup (Weeks 3–4)**  
- **Week 3**:  
  - Set up email server/test environment (Postfix, Mailpit) for simulation.  
  - Deploy message queue (RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka) for email streaming.  
- **Week 4**:  
  - Configure databases: PostgreSQL (user data), Elasticsearch (email logs).  
  - Build basic dashboard skeleton (React + Material UI).  

#### **Phase 3: Email Processing & Feature Engineering (Weeks 5–6)**  
- **Week 5**:  
  - Develop email parser (Python + `email` library) to extract headers, body, and attachments.  
  - Integrate URL scanning (VirusTotal API) and WHOIS lookups.  
- **Week 6**:  
  - Preprocess text (lemmatization, removing HTML tags) and create embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).  
  - Store processed features in Elasticsearch for analytics.  

#### **Phase 4: AI Model Development (Weeks 7–9)**  
- **Week 7**:  
  - Train phishing classifier (BERT or RoBERTa) on labeled datasets.  
  - Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Week 8**:  
  - Build anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest) for sender behavior analysis.  
  - Develop URL risk scorer (Random Forest) using features like domain age, redirects.  
- **Week 9**:  
  - Deploy models via FastAPI or TensorFlow Serving.  
  - Integrate with message queue for real-time scoring.  

#### **Phase 5: Analytics & Threat Intelligence (Weeks 10–11)**  
- **Week 10**:  
  - Create dashboard panels:  
    - Geographic heatmaps of phishing sources.  
    - Top phishing keywords over time (N-gram analysis).  
  - Add MITRE ATT&CK tactic tagging for attacks.  
- **Week 11**:  
  - Implement user risk scoring (frequency of clicking phishing links).  
  - Generate PDF reports (Python-WeasyPrint) for stakeholders.  

#### **Phase 6: Integration & Testing (Weeks 12–13)**  
- **Week 12**:  
  - Test with adversarial emails (obfuscated URLs, polymorphic text).  
  - Validate false positive/negative rates on corporate email samples.  
- **Week 13**:  
  - Optimize model latency (model quantization, caching).  
  - Stress-test ingestion pipeline with 10k+ simulated emails.  

#### **Phase 7: Deployment & Documentation (Week 14)**  
- **Week 14**:  
  - Deploy on AWS/GCP with Kubernetes for scaling.  
  - Write user guides and API documentation (Swagger/Postman).  
  - Demo the system by simulating a phishing campaign.

### **Why This Project?**  
- Combines **NLP** for text analysis, **network protocols** (SMTP/IMAP), and **data engineering** for scalable processing.  
- Directly addresses a critical cybersecurity threat (phishing accounts for 90% of breaches).  
- Demonstrates full-stack skills from low-level email parsing to AI and visualization.
