### **Project Title**: **Distributed AI-Driven Network Traffic Analysis & Predictive Threat Detection System**  
**Domain**: Networking + AI + Data Analytics  
**Objective**: Build a scalable system that collects network traffic data, uses AI to detect anomalies/predict threats, and visualizes insights in real-time. Combines distributed systems, machine learning, and big data analytics.

---

### **Key Components**  
1. **Network Data Collection**: Capture real-time network traffic (packets, flows) using sensors.  
2. **Distributed Data Processing**: Use Apache Kafka/Spark for streaming and batch processing.  
3. **AI/ML Models**:  
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Unsupervised learning (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders).  
   - **Threat Prediction**: Supervised learning (LSTM, Random Forest) trained on historical attack data (e.g., CIC-IDS2017 dataset).  
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize traffic patterns, threats, and predictions (React + D3.js/Elastic Stack).  
5. **Alerting System**: Send real-time alerts via email/Slack for detected threats.

### **Timeline (14 Weeks)**  

#### **Phase 1: Research & Design (Weeks 1–2)**  
- **Week 1**:  
  - Define scope and finalize tools (e.g., Kafka vs. RabbitMQ, PyTorch vs. TensorFlow).  
  - Study network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP) and datasets (e.g., CIC-IDS2017).  
- **Week 2**:  
  - Design system architecture (microservices, data pipelines).  
  - Create ER diagrams for databases and plan API endpoints.  

#### **Phase 2: Environment Setup (Weeks 3–4)**

  - Store processed data in Cassandra.  

#### **Phase 4: AI Model Development (Weeks 7–9)**  
- **Week 7**:  
  - Train anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest) on historical data.  
  - Evaluate performance (F1-score, precision/recall).

  - Deploy models as REST APIs (FastAPI/Flask).  
  - Integrate with Spark for real-time inference.  

#### **Phase 5: Analytics & Visualization (Weeks 10–11)**  
- **Week 10**:  
  - Develop batch analytics (Spark SQL) for traffic trends.  
  - Create real-time dashboards (Elasticsearch + Kibana).  
- **Week 11**:  
  - Add interactive visualizations (D3.js for geolocation maps, heatmaps).  
  - Implement role-based access control (JWT/OAuth).  

#### **Phase 6: Integration & Testing (Weeks 12–13)**  
- **Week 12**:  
  - Stress-test system with simulated DDoS/port-scan attacks.  
  - Validate model accuracy on unseen data.  
- **Week 13**:  
  - Optimize latency/throughput (load balancing, caching).  
  - Write unit/integration tests (PyTest).  

#### **Phase 7: Deployment & Final Report (Week 14)**  
- **Week 14**:  
  - Deploy system on AWS/Azure using Terraform.  
  - Prepare documentation (GitHub Wiki) and demo video.  
  - Present findings in a technical paper (LaTeX).
